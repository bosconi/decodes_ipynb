    "a system into high-level and low-level layers\n",

    "an important aid for exploration and open-ended discovery in what\n",

    "\n",
    "after developing three separate fractal routines – Space-Filling\n",
    "Curves, Gosper Islands, and Koch Curves – a pattern of code\n",

    "of such a commonality positions us well to extract a more generalized\n",
    "routine,\n",
    "\n",
    "While the specific mechanisms employed differed somewhat, the\n",
    "Gosper Island and Koch Snowflake implementations had much in\n",
    "common: both operated on collections of Segments, and controlled\n",
    "subdivision through pairs of coordinates describing Points along a\n",
    "normalized Segment. This subdivision was applied iteratively for each\n",
    "Segment in a collection, and then repeated to generate smaller and\n",
    "smaller units until some condition was satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin developing a more general\n",
