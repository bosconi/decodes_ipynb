    "# E102 A Point Attractor\n",
    "The construction of so-called point attractors has become a popular\n",
    "“hello world” exercise for those just starting out in computational geometry. Attractors are valued for the simplicity of the required algorithm, and the accessibility of the necessary elements (only points and vectors are required).\n",
    "They also appreciated for the formal effects they produce, and their ability\n",
    "to produce differentiated effects within a field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining how this routine\n",
    "works through a formal statement of intent, which we might call a **problem\n",
    "statement**, might lead us to state:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a set of points and an “attractor” point, displace each point in the set some distance related to its proximity to the attractor point. Provide mechanisms for limiting the intensity and for controlling the range of influence of this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of this algorithm includes a rough mechanism for limiting\n",
    "intensity via a maximum translation distance, and for controlling the\n",
    "range of influence via an exponent. A careful unpacking of this simple example\n",
    "will allow us to look at how geometry diagrams, object model diagrams,\n",
    "and control flow diagrams can work in concert to help us understand a\n",
    "geometric computation in depth."

    "The tables below describe the context in which our attractor routine should\n",
