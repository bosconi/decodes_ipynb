    "Most CAD environments provide a means to produce rational curves – those that have a straightforward logic such as circles, ellipses, hyperbolas – as well as freeform curves such as Bézier, Bspline and NURBS curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "While drawing a wide variety of curves is quite easy and intuitive through the interfaces provided by CAD environments, this ***convenience comes at a cost***. The ability to produce gestural forms with ease has not been matched with a comparable level of understanding and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "To engage at this fine-grain level of control, we present in this chapter a lower-level description of a curve than is often presented in CAD: ***the parametric representation***. This offers a lens through which to demonstrate some of the fundamental characteristics and properties of curves most useful in a design context. With this representation, a Curve class will be constructed, key geometric properties will be derived, and typical usage will be demonstrated through examples."
