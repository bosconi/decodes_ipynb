    "A vector in Cartesian three-dimensional space, denoted by $\\mathbb{R}^3$, can be described by a collection of three numbers $(x,y,z)$. As this construction is identical to that of a Cartesian point, it is not surprising that a vector and a point are closely related. In fact, we say that a point in Cartesian space is identified by its corresponding vector. By convention, we will denote a point by a capital letter, such as $P$, and a vector whose head is at that point using the same letter in lower case with an arrow on top, $\\vec{p}$ . Notice that this notational convention holds even when operations are applied; for instance, the head of vector $\\vec{p}_{1} + \\vec{p}_{2}$ is the point $P_{1} + P_{2}$."
