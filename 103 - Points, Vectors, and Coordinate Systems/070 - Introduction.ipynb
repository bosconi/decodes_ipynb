    "Of these three, the **vector** may be understood as the most fundamental from both a mathematical and computational point of view, as well as the most concealed by most CAD software. While vectors are implicitly employed for any number of modeling tasks, they rarely make an appearance on the screen.\n",

    "The use of vectors is fundamental to the representation of nearly every geometric object described numerically, and is foundational to computational geometry. The numeric representation of a vector in Cartesian space consists of three numbers that together describe a direction and magnitude.\n",
