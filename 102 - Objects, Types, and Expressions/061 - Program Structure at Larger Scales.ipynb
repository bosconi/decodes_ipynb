    "### Structuring Mechanisms at Progressively Larger Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expressions and Statements\n",
    "Expressions are formed of chains of object references (variables) and operators which combine into larger statements, typically within a single line of code. Reading and writing expressions is essential to basic computational literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Flow Structures\n",
    "All imperative programming languages, including Python, offer special expressions that control the order in which groups of statements are executed, under what conditions they are executed, or how many times they are repeatedly executed. Familiar examples may include loops, if-then statements, and iterators. Fluency in these methods allows one to move past simple ‘macro-like’ routines and onto full-fledged scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions\n",
    "A sequence of statements can be packaged as a unit in order to manipulate given data, or to return new data to any statement which calls upon it. The creation of functional subroutines is an important part of managing programs of even modest levels of complexity, as it allows for the production of generalized methods that may be applied to a variety of concrete situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes\n",
    "The ability to author one’s own data types, or classes, offers access to one of the most powerful techniques of object-oriented programming: data abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modules\n",
    "Navigating the separation of low-level implementations from high-level interfaces allows us to structure the product of our own work in a modular way and to take advantage of the work of others, even without a deep understanding of the mechanics of that work. "

    "Python provides a unique mechanism for defining codeblocks that utilizes the whitespace of the script, thereby aligning the visual structure of the script on the screen with the breakdown of its logical units by the compiler.
